
- visit all "task" nodes

for each task ("forwards"):
	- create a structure by id, as in .gan file, 
	    containing ES, duration, EF, start, end
	- containing a list of all successors (correcting ES dates?)
	- find end node (that with max EF)

- for each task ("backwards") starting from end node:
	- find all predecessors, creating or correcting LS, LF, slack
	- label as critical the nodes whose slack is 0
